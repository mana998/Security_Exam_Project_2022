Do you want some inspiration on what to cook? Are you not sure what can you do with the ingredients you have in your fridge? Then this app is for you!

You can search for recipes based on your ingredients or just get inspired by most popular ones.

If you like a recipe, you can give it a like for easy access, but if later you figure out it is not to your liking anymore, just by one click you can remove it again.

You can also store your own recipes and share them with others. Can you make it to the most popular ones?

In case you realize you made a mistake in the recipe steps or just want to update better picture, just go to your account, find the recipe and update it.

Is there a recipe you really want to do but don't have enough ingredients? Is your best friend online right now? Just message them and ask them to bring you the rest of the ingredients and you can enjoy a meal together.

Are you scared of commitments? Don't worry, you don't need to create account to use our page. You won't be able to store the recipes in your favorites, chat with other users or add your own recipes, but you can still get access to all the other recipes.
